# Intelligent Irrigation Controller
 
The goal of the project was to create an intelligent drip irrigation controller capable of detecting which is the best moment of the day to activate the irrigation based on solar cycle and soil moisture.
The device collects information from light and humidity sensors and makes decisions on when to activate the irrigation and uploads to the cloud sensor parameters and controller status in order to monitor them.
Allowing to improve by 80% water consumption,  automation of self-regulated irrigation by the sun, adapting naturally to different climates and environments.

### Programming the Arduino microcontroller.
* Manufacturing and calibration of sensors.
* Design and manufacture of electronic circuit.
* The project was awarded and subsidized by a national investment fund Seed Capital 2014 (Argentina).
